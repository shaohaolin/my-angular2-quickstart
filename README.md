# my-angular2-quickstart

This is a repo that was my first attempt of Angular2. I used Angular2 QuickStart as my seed project.

This repo contains all my curiosity of Angular2 with my study notes that I found that it is interested to record.

##Notes
1. How does import work in Angular 2?
   <br/> Relative path and absolute path for import different files, components.

2. Instance Angular 2 Component Two times
   <br/> Bootstrap angular 2 compoents, different with bootstrap components and non-bootstrap components.
	Cannot use single bootstrap component twice on the same page. Non-main components can be created
	as much as you want.
