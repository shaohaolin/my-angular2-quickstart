# my-angular2-quickstart

This is a repo that was my first attempt of Angular2. I used Angular2 QuickStart as my seed project.

This repo contains all my curiosities of Angular2 with my study notes that I found that it is interesting to record.

##Notes
###1. How does import work in Angular 2?
Relative path and absolute path for import different files, components.

###2. Instance Angular 2 Component Two times
Bootstrap angular 2 compoents, different with bootstrap components and non-bootstrap components.
	Cannot use single bootstrap component twice on the same page. Non-main components can be created
	as much as you want.

###3. How to create an empty object based on interface file in component
Case produce:<br/>
I need to create a form filled in with empty object attributes. I got **object.attribute is undefined** error. What I did before is:
```javascript
   // dj is an interface.
   public newDj : dj;
```
And for the HTML, I used `ngModel` for two-way bindings:
```html
<div class="form-group">
	<label for="name">Name</label>
	<input type="text" class="form-control" required 
	   	[(ngModel)] = "newDj.name" />
</div>
```
The reason for this is becasue `public newDj : dj;` just declared an object called `newDj` and type of `newDj` is dj. It didn't create an instance of `dj`.
	After read the [post: How can I create an object based on an interface file definition in TypeScript?](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/13142635/how-can-i-create-an-object-based-on-an-interface-file-definition-in-typescript), with this [gentle man](http://stackoverflow.com/users/3180970/user3180970)'s solution.
I did:
```javascript
public newDj = <dj>{};
```
Boom, fixed the problem!

###4. How to pass and access input properties in a component class?
Case produce:<br/>
I learned how to pass properties from Angular 2 tutorial. It uses square brackets for binding and declares **inputs: [...]**. I can access the input properties in the component template without errors. However, I had a **property ... is undefined.** if I try to display the property in a component class.<br/>
Parent template:
```html
<dj-form *ngIf="openNewForm" [rankvalue]="currentRank"></dj-form>
```
Child Component code:
```typescript
@Component({
	selector: 'dj-form',
	templateUrl: 'app/dj-form/dj-form.component.html',
	inputs: ['rankvalue']
})
export class DjFormComponent {
	public newDj = <dj> {};

	createDj() {
		consolo.log(rankvalue);
		consolo.log(this.rankvalue);
	}
}
```
Obviously, I don't have any access or any variable called **rankvalue**. But what does `inputs` in the component annotation do?
<br/>
I can get this value by injecting service to watch this variable. But I don't want to do that. 
Is it any other way that I can access the property in a component class? After read [this article](http://tombuyse.com/accessing-input-properties-in-a-component-class-angular-2/), I got a solution. And I favor the solution that [Tom Buyse](http://tombuyse.com/accessing-input-properties-in-a-component-class-angular-2/) showed in his blog.
I changed child component code:
```typescript
@Component({
	selector: 'dj-form',
	templateUrl: 'app/dj-form/dj-form.component.html',
})

export class DjFormComponent {
	@Input() rankvalue;

	createDj() {
		consolo.log(this.rankvalue);
	}
}
```
No more non sense `inputs` array in component. I like this solution because it clearly shows the scope of input properties and also it looks like Angular 1 for people like me did a lot angular 1 projects. `@input() rankvalue'` is similar to `$scope.rankvalue` for binding value to directive in angular 1. [Tom Buyse](http://tombuyse.com/accessing-input-properties-in-a-component-class-angular-2/) also mentioned that we are not able to access the input properites before the view is rendering.

###5. Is selector attribute necessary for Component?
Selector is not necessary. I discovered this after I implemented routing in the app. It's no harm to have one in the component anyway.

###6. How to apply different html classes based on dynamic value?
I have `ngFor` for looping through an array of objects. Each object has multiple attributes. I want to apply different materializecss grid class based on object's ranking (one of the attribute of the object). Here is what I want.

![Dashboard](https://github.com/shaohaolin/my-angular2-quickstart/blob/master/app/images/dashboard-design.png)

Here is what I do using `ngClass` in Angular 2.
```html
<div class="col s12" *ngFor="#dj of Djs" [ngClass]="{l6: dj.rank === 1, l3: dj.rank < 6, l2: dj.rank >= 6}">
</div>
```
Because I need to evaluate 3 different expressions, I use `ngClass` for apply different style class. I could use the syntax like `[class.l6]="dj.rank===1"`, works in Angular 2. However, the limitation is I can't do multiple evaluation at a time. I have to write a lot `[class....]="..."` to make this happen. 

###7. How to make one to many relationship in Typescript?
I am at the stage that I want to develop a one-to-many relation for Dj object. It makes sense that each Dj has a lot of songs, but how can I implement in Typescript?

![One-To-Many](https://github.com/shaohaolin/my-angular2-quickstart/blob/master/app/images/One-to-many.JPG)

Define a Song class and import to Dj interface:
```Typescript
import {Song} from './song'
export interface Dj {
	id: number;
	name: string;
	rank: number;
	imageUrl?: string;
	songs?: Song[];
}

```
Notice that: the question mark ? indicated that the attribute is optional, another words, is not required. I feel like I should define Dj to **Class** instead of **interface** because now I need some logic for Dj class and I can have some setter and getter function, particular useful for setting and getting songs. But for now, I will just leave it as interface, cause it does its job.

###8. How to filter an array based on some value in TypeScript way?
Recall from Question 7, I have a one-to-many relationship in my application: one Dj has many songs. Now I encouter a problem that if I receive 100 random songs from the backend, how can I quickly identify which song belongs to which Dj? An Easy way to implment this is to let backend handle it by passing the ``dj_id`` through API and writes an query to get all the songs belong to this ``dj_id``. What if I don't have the luxury, I have to handle it in the front-end side? (Yeah, I know, the backend guy is too lazy.) Luckily, I can use `arr.filter()` method which is a standard function in ES5. I wasn't so sure how to use `arr.filter()` in TypeScript; however, [John Papa](http://johnpapa.net/) shows a good example in his repo.

```TypeScript
getHero(id: number) {
	return Promise.resolve(HEROES).then(
		heroes => heroes.filter(h => h.id === id)[0]
	);
}
```
Basically, it is saying get me all `h`(hero) that saticified its `id` is equivalent to the `id` passing from the parameter. Excatly what I want: give me all the songs that belong to this Dj. 

My implmentation:
```TypeScript
getSongsByDjId(dj_id: number) {
	return Promise.resolve(songs).then(
		songs => songs.filter(song => song.dj_id === dj_id)
	)
}
```
A question might rise: Where does this `song` come from? <br/> `song` is a temporary variable that reference an element of `songs`. I can name it whatever I want.

###9. What changes do I need to do to my SystemJS config blocks to tell it to look in dist/ for the compiled JS files?
I believe a lot of people like me who is very new to SystemJS and TypeScript don't like the **.js** and **.js.map** complie right beside **.ts**. I would like to separate src files and complie files. But, how to do that and also tell SystemJS to look into that?
<br/>First, need to add **outDir** attribute in `tsconfig.json` file. **outDir** allows you to [redirect output structure to the directory].(http://json.schemastore.org/tsconfig)
```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "target": "ES5",
    "module": "system",
    "moduleResolution": "node",
    "sourceMap": true,
    "emitDecoratorMetadata": true,
    "experimentalDecorators": true,
    "removeComments": false,
    "noImplicitAny": false,
    "outDir": "dist"
  },
  "exclude": [
    "node_modules"
  ]
}
```

And then, I need to tell SystemJS to look in the `dist` folder, because I ask to put all the complier `.js` and `.js.map` code to my `dist/` folder.
```javascript
System.config({
	map: { app: 'dist'},
    packages: {        
      app: {
        format: 'register',
        defaultExtension: 'js'
      }
    }
  });
  System.import('app/boot')
        .then(null, console.error.bind(console));
```
According to [Rob Wormald](https://github.com/robwormald), I need to add `map: { app: 'dist' }` in the `System.config()`. Very nice, now the structure of the application is much nicer and I can just git ignore the src folder.
